# SOCandAutomation
In this assignment, my task was to create an automated response to an observed IOC within an environment managed by Wazuh. I leveraged Alienvault OTX as a threat intel source, Wazuh as my SIEM & EDR and Shuffler.io as my SOAR. The primary focus here was to demonstrate my ability to contribute to SOC automation, bringing together threat intel, EDR, SIEM and SOAR.
